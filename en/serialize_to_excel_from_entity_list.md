# Serialize to Excel from entity list

**Action Grid** too offers the possibility to serialize to CSV, and now with the Excel addon you can serialize from entity list - basically some or all the entries of a grid of your choice. Similar to Serialize from Text, add a grid button with Action Serialize > Serialize from Entity List. You have the possibility to choose which entities to export to XLS, and even to include all fields at once by ticking one single button. 

**Entity Name** - name of the enitity you want to use. (Optional, can be used with the Load Entity (Sql) action)

**Fields** - provide a list of fields you want to serialize. (Optional)

**Include all fields** - check this option if you want to serialize all fields.

**Remove Fields Names** - check this option if you do not want to serialize the names of the fields.

**Use excel formulas** - with this option checked all formulas found will be applied.

**Criteria** - add a criteria that fielters the data. (Optional)

**Pattern** - you can provide a pattern for the excel file. (Optional)

**Handle duplicates** - you can choose how to handle when you already have a file with the same name. (Optional, default value is "Rename")

This extension is also available for DNN Api Endpoint and Sharp Scheduler.
