# Serialize to Excel from entity list

**Action Grid** too offers the possibility to serialize to CSV, and now with the Excel addon you can serialize from entity list - basically some or all the entries of a grid of your choice. Similar to Serialize from Text, add a grid button with Action Serialize > Serialize from Entity List. You have the possibility to choose which entities to export to XLS, and even to include all fields at once by ticking one single button.

This extension is also available for DNN Api Endpoint and Sharp Scheduler.
